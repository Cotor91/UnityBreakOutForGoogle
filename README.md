# UnityBreakOutForGoogle
Project 4 of the Google apprenticeship application projects

To test the game you need to:

Download the repository.

Go into the BreakOut folder within it.

Run BreakOutGame.exe

Select Windowed for best results. 



FURTHERMORE: The coding I wrote is the C# (file extension .cs) in the assets folder.
